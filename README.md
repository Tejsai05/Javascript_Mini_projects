# Javascript_Mini_projects
This repository contains a collection of simple JavaScript mini projects I created to understand core concepts like DOM manipulation, events, loops, arrays, functions, and conditionals. Each project focuses on a specific topic and helped me learn JavaScript by practicing real examples and building logic through hands-on coding.
