# JavaScript Mini Projects ðŸš€

This repository is a growing collection of JavaScript mini projects that I'm building daily as I learn. Each project focuses on a specific concept like DOM manipulation, events, arrays, functions, loops, and more.

I'm using these small, practical examples to understand JavaScript better through hands-on practice. New projects will be added regularly as I continue my learning journey.

Feel free to explore and follow along!
